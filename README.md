# String-to-ASCII
Produces the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) representation of each character of a string input.

This ASCII Converter is a very simple program that allows users to input a string and displays the corresponding ASCII values for each character in the string. 

I wrote this in three different languages: Python, JavaScript, and C++.

## PYTHON
  The Python version of the ASCII Converter prompts the user to enter  word, which is stored in a variable "str" and loops through each letter in the string to print its ASCII value using the "ord()" function.

## JAVASCRIPT
  The JavaScript version of the ASCII Converter collects the user's input from an HTML input element, converts each character to its ASCII value, and displays the results on the webpage.
The user types a string into an HTML input field.
The function "ascii()" reads the input value, loops through its characters and converts each character to its ASCII value using "charCodeAt()". It stores the values into two variables: "text" and "content".
The results are displayed on the webpage and logged to the console.

## C++
  The C++ version, similarly to the python version, reads a string input from the user via the console and iterates over each character to print their ASCII values using type casting to int.
